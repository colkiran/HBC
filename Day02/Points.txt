Locality of Reference
---------------------
Numpy arrays are stored in continous memory location unlike lists, hence its faster compared to lists

    CO  C1  C2
R0   1   2   3
R1   4   5   6
R2   7   8   9

it happens in C than python


Rules
-----
the arrays have same shape

the arrays have the same number of dimensions and the length of each dimension is either of common length 1

if the array has different number of dimensions then the array with fewer dimensions can have its shape prepended

Dataframe - import data from different sources - CSV, EXCEL, JSON, XML, Database

Cleanse the data - remove unnecessary rows and columns
